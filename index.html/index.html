<H2 style="color: palevioletred">Family</H2>
    <p>Above all my jobs, my dedication to my family means the most to me! I make sure to see them as often as I can,
        especially being in my final year of college. There is a chance in the next few years, I may be farther away than every before.
        In the photo on the right pictured is myself and my younger sister, Bella. She just began her college career,
        and I couldn't be more proud of her! She is easily one of the best people in my life. Right now, most of my family lives
        in New Hampshire while I complete college, my sister currently attends Plymouth State University. At home, we also have
        a pet cat, her name is Cleopatra and beloved by everyone in my family.</p>

<h2 style="color: palevioletred">Friends</h2>
<p> In college, you learn that friends can become another family. I've been lucky to have met some of the most amazing people during
    my college career. Pictured to the left is a photo of my best friend's wedding photo where I was his Groom's maid in January 2017. This
    was one of the best nights and being there for such an important moment in my friend's life was something I'll never forget.
    Opportunities like these, besides my degree, I consider the most valuable part of college. I've met people who have been able to help
    me see the world around me in new ways,educated in more ways than a school could ever provide, and have felt more love surrounding me
    now more than any other part of my young life. Friends I've made in college have helped figure out the good and bad of my personality and
    I've grown more confident in who I am as an individual.
